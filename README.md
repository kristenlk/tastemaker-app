# Tastemaker

Tastemaker helps users find the perfect restaurant.

After detecting their location, Tastemaker uses the Yelp and Google Maps APIs to allow users to pick what they're looking for in a restaurant (distance, type of food, and price range). Tastemaker then returns the highest-rated restaurant to them. If they don't like the highest-rated restaurant - perhaps they've already visted it and would like to try something new - they can click to view the next-highest-rated place.

Users can also favorite a restaurant, which saves the restaurant name, location / contact information, and Yelp URL for later.
